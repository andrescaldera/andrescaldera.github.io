Great spontaneous moments remain longer in our memories and as a documentarist, that’s what I specialize in capturing.

There are 2 approaches to our session, photo-tours and paparazzi style. In the photo-tour we visit the best places of the city while discussing and capturing great moments. The “paparazzi” approach gives you more liberty of doing anything you’d wish while I capture natural moments without intruding. Together we work out what is best for you and your plans.
