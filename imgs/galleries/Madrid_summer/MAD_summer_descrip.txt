Madrid Summer Colors

I had the opportunity to visit the Spanish capital for a couple of days which I spent moving across the entire city. I learned a few things, firstly that Madrid is incredibly beautiful (especially in summer), also Iâ€™d say 2 days is not enough to see it all but then its always good to have reasons to come back. I hope that through these photographs you feel a bit of the magic of the city.
