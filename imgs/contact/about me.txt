My name is Andrés Caldera, I’m a freelance Photographer & Videographer.  I specialize in creating stories within the line between nature and civilization; how people interact with the space they are given, producing top-quality photos and documentary-style videography. This website is a space to bring together my audiovisual work I hope you enjoy it!.For enquiries, project proposals and anything I can be of use, please use the form below.
